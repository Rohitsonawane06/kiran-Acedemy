1)what is flow control statement in python?and what are types?
Answer:
Flow control statements in Python are used to control the execution flow of a program based on conditions or loops. They determine the sequence in which the program's code is executed.
There are 3 types
Conditional Statements:
Looping Statements/iterative statements:
Transfer statements:

2)What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?
Answer:
Conditional statements in Python are used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is True. They enable decision-making in a program based on conditions.

3)What is the syntax of an if statement in Python?
Answer:
The syntax of an if statement is:
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
	
4)Can you use an else statement without an if statement in Python?
Answer:
No, an else statement must always be paired with an if statement.

5)What is the difference between if and if-else statements?
Answer:
if =>executes a block of code if the condition is True. If the condition is False, no code is executed.
if-else=> executes one block of code if the condition is True and another block if the condition is False.

6)Can Python's if statements check multiple conditions?
Answer:
Yes, multiple conditions can be checked using logical operators like and, or, and not. For example:
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute
	
7)How does Python handle nested if statements?
Answer:
Nested if statements are if statements inside another if block. Python executes the inner if block only if the outer condition is True. 
eg.
n1=int(input('enter num: '))
if num>10:
	if num>12:
		print('hello')
#output:
enter num:9

8)What is the elif keyword, and how does it differ from multiple if statements?
Answer:
The elif keyword is used for multiple conditions in a sequence. Only one block is executed when a condition evaluates to True.
Multiple if statements are independent, and each one is evaluated regardless of the others.

9)What happens if you omit the colon (:) in a conditional statement?
Answer:
Python will throw a SyntaxError because the colon is required to define the start of the conditional block.

10)Explain how conditional statements work with boolean values.
Answer:
In Python, conditional statements evaluate expressions to boolean values (True or False). Based on the result:

If the condition evaluates to True, the corresponding block of code is executed.
If False, the block is skipped or the else block (if present) is executed.

11)Can you use a single-line conditional statement in Python? If yes, how?
Answer:
Yes, Python allows single-line conditional statements using the ternary operator. The syntax is:
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
eg.
num=10
print('greater' if num>5 else 'less')
#output:
greater

12)What is the difference between if-elif and multiple if statements?
Answer:
In an if-elif structure, only the first condition that evaluates to True is executed, and the rest are ignored.
In multiple if statements, all the conditions are evaluated, and multiple blocks can execute if their conditions are True.

eg.for if elif
num=10
if num>5:
	print('hello')
elif num>7:
	print('welcome')
#output:
hello

eg. for if statemets
num=10
if num>5:
	print('hello')
if num>7:
	print('welcome')
#output:
hello
welcome

13)What are the limitations of Python's conditional statements?
Answer:
They can become complex and hard to read with deeply nested conditions.
Python does not support a direct switch-case statement (like in some other languages), so multiple if-elif conditions must be used as a substitute.
Conditions must evaluate to a boolean value; otherwise, an error may occur.

14)Can you have an if statement without an else block? Why?
Answer:
Yes, you can have an if statement without an else block. The else block is optional because it is only used to specify actions when the condition evaluates to False.
