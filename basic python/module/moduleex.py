it is process to convert the bytestrem is called the pickling
the bystream to send the second file is called unpickling



Pickling converts a Python object into a byte stream, which can then be stored in a file or transmitted over a network. This process is also known as serialization or marshalling. The pickle module in Python provides the functionality for pickling objects.

Unpickling is the reverse process of pickling, where a byte stream is converted back into a Python object. This is also known as deserialization. The pickle module is also used for unpickling objects
